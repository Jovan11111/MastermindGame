# Mastermind Game
This repository contains a Mastermind game implemented in JavaScript. The game features a user-friendly interface for playing Mastermind, understanding the rules, and exploring an algorithm that solves Mastermind puzzles. The project includes several pages to provide a comprehensive user experience.
